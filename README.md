# Game time

The aim is a tech ninja game to learn vs code or any keybindings. Very much a work in progress

## The original concept

I wanted to improve at using redux so what better way that to make a game. I was reading a lot of Demon Slayers so I kept thing of Tanjiro's training running down the hill, that stone, the previous students and Sakonji Urokodaki.

So a game it was. One of the many things I have repeated tried to learn was touch typing and shortcuts. I really liked [vim adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) so those where the things that I've floating around my head.

## This is very much a work in progress

- [ ] export and import keybindings
- [ ] monster sprites
- [ ] game mechanics
- [ ] game map designs and so many design things

Realistically this is a bit of a on going pet prodject. We'll see what happens.
